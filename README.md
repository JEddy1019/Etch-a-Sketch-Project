# Etch-a-Sketch-Project

- container height of 24px is needed per row and column

- if you want to add an event listener to an array-like element, use a loop

- remember to google errors if your stuck

- when a lot of boxes are present the page slows down a lot, should look for a way to resolve that

- need to find a way to remove squares in container so that I can add new ones

- remember that calling functions is different from calling built in methods e.g addEventListener
